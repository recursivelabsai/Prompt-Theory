## Code of Conduct

The Prompt Theory project is committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment. All participants in our project and community are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

We aim to:
- Be inclusive and respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Harassment of any participants in any form
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 1.13+
- Familiarity with our [Mathematical Framework](docs/mathematical_framework.md)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/prompt-theory.git
   cd prompt-theory
   ```
3. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
5. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We use a modified Git Flow approach:

- `main`: The latest stable release
- `develop`: The development branch for the next release
- `feature/xxx`: Feature branches for new features and non-critical bug fixes
- `fix/xxx`: Hotfix branches for critical bug fixes
- `research/xxx`: Research branches for experimental features

### Issue Tracking

- Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/recursivelabs/prompt-theory/issues) for open issues
- If you find a bug or have a feature request, check if it's already reported before creating a new issue
- For bugs, include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior
- For features, describe the proposed functionality, its benefits, and potential implementation approach

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Feature Branch**: Always create a branch from `develop` for your work
2. **Develop Your Contribution**: Make your changes in your feature branch
3. **Write Tests**: Add tests that verify your contribution
4. **Run Tests Locally**: Ensure all tests pass before submitting
5. **Update Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Submit your PR against the `develop` branch
7. **Code Review**: Address any feedback from reviewers
8. **Merge**: Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

## Coding Standards

We follow standard Python conventions with some specifics:

### Style Guide

- Code should conform to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting
- Use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
- Use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting

### Documentation

- All functions, classes, and methods should have docstrings following [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
- Type hints should be used consistently

### Testing

- All code should be covered by unit tests
- Use pytest for testing
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage

## Documentation Guidelines

Good documentation is crucial for the success of this project. Here are our guidelines:

### Code Documentation

- Use clear and concise docstrings
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Include examples for complex functions

### Project Documentation

- API documentation should be comprehensive and kept up-to-date
- Tutorials should be accessible to newcomers
- Advanced topics should be covered in depth

### Mathematical Documentation

- All mathematical formulations should be clearly explained
- Use consistent notation throughout
- Provide references to relevant literature
- Include intuitive explanations alongside formal definitions

## Research Contributions

Research contributions are highly valued in the Prompt Theory project:

### Experimental Results

- All experiments should be reproducible
- Code for experiments should be included
- Data should be made available when possible
- Analysis should be thorough and unbiased

### Theoretical Contributions

- New theoretical frameworks should be well-motivated
- Connections to existing work should be explicit
- Limitations should be acknowledged
- Practical implications should be discussed

### Literature Reviews

- Comprehensive coverage of relevant work
- Fair and balanced assessment of contributions
- Clear organization of material
- Identification of gaps and future directions

## Community and Communication

### Communication Channels
