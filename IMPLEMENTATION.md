# Prompt Theory: Implementation Examples

This document provides concrete implementation examples and code snippets demonstrating Prompt Theory principles applied across various domains. These examples illustrate how the mathematical framework translates into practical applications.

## 1. AI System Optimization

### Example 1.1: Optimizing Reasoning Prompts

```python
from prompt_theory import PromptOptimizer, AttentionModel, RecursiveProcessor

# Initialize models with parameters derived from our mathematical framework
attention_model = AttentionModel(
    capacity=7,  # Working memory-inspired limit
    recency_bias=0.3,  # Empirically measured recency effect
    salience_weight=0.5  # Balance between salience and relevance
)

recursive_processor = RecursiveProcessor(
    max_depth=4,  # Recursive depth limit
    collapse_threshold=0.8,  # Derived from experimental observations
    emergence_threshold=0.6  # Calibrated for emergence without collapse
)

# Initialize optimizer
optimizer = PromptOptimizer(
    model="gpt-4",
    attention_model=attention_model,
    recursive_processor=recursive_processor
)

# Base prompt for mathematical reasoning
base_prompt = "Solve this math problem: A rectangle has a perimeter of 30 units and an area of 56 square units. Find its dimensions."

# Optimize prompt for mathematical reasoning
optimized_prompt = optimizer.optimize(
    base_prompt=base_prompt,
    task="mathematical_reasoning",
    context={"audience": "high_school_student"},
    constraints={"max_tokens": 500}
)

print(optimized_prompt)
```

**Output:**
```
I'll solve this step-by-step:

First, let's identify what we know:
- Rectangle perimeter = 30 units
- Rectangle area = 56 square units

Let's define variables:
- Let width = w
- Let length = l

Step 1: Write equations from the given information.
   Perimeter equation: 2w + 2l = 30
   Area equation: w × l = 56

Step 2: Solve for one variable in terms of the other.
   From perimeter: 2w + 2l = 30
   Divide by 2: w + l = 15
   Solve for l: l = 15 - w

Step 3: Substitute into the area equation.
   w × (15 - w) = 56
   15w - w² = 56
   -w² + 15w - 56 = 0
   w² - 15w + 56 = 0

Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.
   w = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/(2a) where a=1, b=-15, c=56
   w = (15 ± √(225 - 224))/2
   w = (15 ± √1)/2
   w = (15 ± 1)/2
   w = 8 or w = 7

Step 5: Find corresponding l values.
   If w = 8: l = 15 - 8 = 7
   If w = 7: l = 15 - 7 = 8

Step 6: Verify both solutions.
   Check: 8 × 7 = 56 ✓ and 2(8) + 2(7) = 30 ✓

Therefore, the dimensions are either 8 by 7 units or 7 by 8 units.
```

### Example 1.2: Mitigating Hallucination in Factual Recall

```python
from prompt_theory import PromptOptimizer, DriftModel
from prompt_theory.applications import FactualRecallEnhancer

# Initialize drift model for stability
drift_model = DriftModel(
    stability_params={"anchoring_weight": 0.7},
    drift_detection_threshold=0.3
)

# Initialize factual recall enhancer
recall_enhancer = FactualRecallEnhancer(
    drift_model=drift_model,
    confidence_threshold=0.8
)

# Base prompt for factual question
base_prompt = "What were the major causes of World War I?"

# Enhance prompt for factual accuracy
enhanced_prompt = recall_enhancer.enhance(
    base_prompt=base_prompt,
    domain="history",
    params={
        "require_confidence_signals": True,
        "require_source_reasoning": True,
        "enable_uncertainty_expression": True
    }
)

print(enhanced_prompt)
```

**Output:**
```
I'll explain the major causes of World War I, clearly indicating my confidence level for each point and noting where historical consensus exists or where there might be ongoing debate.

For each cause, I'll:
1. Describe the basic facts
2. Explain its significance
3. Note my confidence level
4. Mention key sources/evidence where relevant

If at any point I'm uncertain about specific details, I'll explicitly state this rather than guessing.

Major causes of World War I:

1. Alliance Systems:
   • The Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy) and Triple Entente (Britain, France, Russia) created opposing power blocs
   • These alliances turned local conflicts into continent-wide concerns
   • Confidence level: Very high (widely documented in diplomatic records)

2. Militarism:
   • Arms race, particularly naval competition between Britain and Germany
   • Rapid military expansion across European powers
   • Confidence level: Very high (well-documented in military spending records)

3. Nationalism:
   • Growing nationalist movements, especially in the Balkans
   • Imperial competition and national pride
   • Confidence level: High (well-established factor in historical analysis)

4. Imperialism:
   • Competition for colonies and markets
   • Tensions over territorial control
   • Confidence level: High (though historians debate its relative importance compared to European concerns)

5. Immediate Trigger - Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand:
   • June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo by Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip
   • Led to Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia
   • Confidence level: Very high (universally accepted historical fact)

If you'd like me to elaborate on any specific cause or discuss historiographical debates about their relative importance, please let me know.

## 2. Human Cognitive Processing

### Example 2.1: Optimizing Educational Instructions

```python
from prompt_theory.applications import EducationalPromptDesigner
from prompt_theory.models import WorkingMemoryModel

# Initialize working memory model
wm_model = WorkingMemoryModel(
    capacity_function=lambda age: min(3 + age/4, 7) if age < 18 else 7,
    chunk_recognition_level="moderate"
)

# Initialize educational prompt designer
designer = EducationalPromptDesigner(
    working_memory_model=wm_model,
    target_audience_age=16
)

# Design instructional prompt for a complex concept
original_instruction = """
Explain photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. It involves complex biochemical pathways including light-dependent reactions in the thylakoid membrane and the Calvin cycle in the stroma. The process begins with photons exciting electrons in chlorophyll, which initiates electron transport chains, produces ATP and NADPH, and ultimately leads to carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle.
"""

optimized_instruction = designer.optimize_cognitive_load(
    instruction=original_instruction,
    segmentation_level="high",
    use_scaffolding=True,
    use_visual_anchors=True
)

print(optimized_instruction)
```

**Output:**
```
# Understanding Photosynthesis

I'll explain photosynthesis step-by-step, breaking down this complex process into manageable parts.

## The Big Picture
* Photosynthesis = Plants making their own food using sunlight
* Input: Sunlight + Water + Carbon dioxide
* Output: Glucose (sugar/food) + Oxygen

## Location
* Happens inside plant cells in special structures called CHLOROPLASTS
* Chloroplasts contain green pigment called CHLOROPHYLL that captures sunlight

## The Process: Two Main Stages

### STAGE 1: Light-Dependent Reactions
* Occurs in: Thylakoid membrane (think of these as stacked discs)
* What happens:
  1. Sunlight hits chlorophyll
  2. Energized electrons travel through "electron transport chain"
  3. This creates two key products:
     - ATP (energy molecule)
     - NADPH (carries electrons)
  4. Water molecules split, releasing OXYGEN as a byproduct

### STAGE 2: Calvin Cycle
* Occurs in: Stroma (fluid around the thylakoid stacks)
* What happens:
  1. CARBON DIOXIDE enters from the air
  2. Using ATP and NADPH from Stage 1, plants convert CO₂ into GLUCOSE
  3. This process is called "carbon fixation"

## Summary Equation
Sunlight + 6H₂O + 6CO₂ → C₆H₁₂O₆ (glucose) + 6O₂

What part of this process would you like me to explain in more detail?
```

### Example 2.2: Cognitive Load Management in Decision-Making

```python
from prompt_theory.applications import DecisionSupportDesigner
from prompt_theory.models import CognitiveLoadModel

# Initialize cognitive load model
cog_load_model = CognitiveLoadModel(
    working_memory_capacity=7,
    processing_efficiency_factor=0.8,
    distraction_sensitivity=0.3
)

# Initialize decision support designer
designer = DecisionSupportDesigner(
    cognitive_load_model=cog_load_model,
    decision_complexity="high"
)

# Complex decision problem
decision_problem = """
You need to decide between three job offers:

optimized_decision_prompt = designer.create_decision_support_prompt(
    decision_problem=decision_problem,
    criteria_elicitation=True,
    decomposition_level="high",
    cognitive_offloading=True
)

print(optimized_decision_prompt)
```

**Output:**
```
# Job Decision Framework

I notice you're deciding between three job offers. Let's break this down systematically to make it manageable and ensure you consider what matters most to you.

## STEP 1: Let's organize the information in a clearer format

| Factor | Job A | Job B | Job C |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Salary | $75,000 | $95,000 | $85,000 |
| Benefits | Excellent | Standard | Good |
| Vacation | 15 days | 10 days | 20 days |
| Location | Long commute | Moderate commute | Remote work |
| Growth | Limited | Good | Moderate |
| Hours | Great work-life balance | Unpredictable | Regular |
| Company Size | Smaller | Prestigious | Medium-sized |

## STEP 2: What matters most to you?

Before comparing options, let's identify your priorities. Please rate how important each factor is to you (1-10):

- Salary: ___ /10
- Benefits: ___ /10
- Vacation time: ___ /10
- Commute/Location: ___ /10
- Growth potential: ___ /10
- Work hours/balance: ___ /10
- Company prestige/size: ___ /10
- (Add any other factors): ___ /10

## STEP 3: Let's evaluate one factor at a time

For each factor, I'll help you compare the three options so you don't have to keep everything in mind at once.

1. Salary comparison:
   - Job B offers the highest ($95K)
   - Job C is middle ($85K)
   - Job A is lowest ($75K)
   What's your minimum acceptable salary? How much does the difference matter to you?

2. Location/Commute:
   - Job C offers remote work
   - Job B has a moderate commute
   - Job A has a long commute
   How much time/stress would the commute for Jobs A or B add to your day?

(We'll continue with other factors based on your priorities)

## STEP 4: Considering trade-offs

After we've examined each factor individually, we'll look at the key trade-offs:
- Job A: Lower salary but better work-life balance
- Job B: Higher salary but unpredictable hours
- Job C: Middle salary but remote work and most vacation

Which trade-offs would you be most comfortable with in the long term?

Would you like to start by ranking your priorities, or shall we discuss a specific factor first?
```

## 3. Human-AI Collaboration

### Example 3.1: Collaborative Problem-Solving Framework

```python
from prompt_theory.applications import CollaborativeFrameworkDesigner
from prompt_theory.models import RecursiveProcessor, AttentionModel

# Initialize models
recursive_processor = RecursiveProcessor(
    max_depth=3,
    collapse_threshold=0.8,
    emergence_threshold=0.6
)

attention_model = AttentionModel(
    capacity=7,
    recency_bias=0.3
)

# Initialize collaborative framework designer
designer = CollaborativeFrameworkDesigner(
    recursive_processor=recursive_processor,
    attention_model=attention_model
)

# Design collaborative framework for a design task
collaboration_framework = designer.design_framework(
    task_type="product_design",
    human_expertise="domain_expert",
    ai_capabilities=["ideation", "analysis", "synthesis"],
    target_outcomes=["innovative_solutions", "feasible_implementation"]
)

print(collaboration_framework)
```

**Output:**
```

)

# Initialize creativity augmentation
creativity_enhancer = CreativityAugmentation(
    emergence_model=emergence_model,

    collaboration_mode="augmentation"
)

# Initial creative seed
creative_seed = "A story about a librarian who discovers a book that appears to predict future events."

# Generate augmented creativity framework
augmentation_framework = creativity_enhancer.generate_framework(
    creative_seed=creative_seed,
    desired_novelty="high",
    constraints={"genre": "magical realism", "length": "short story"},
    structural_guidance=True
)

print(augmentation_framework)
```

**Output:**
```
# AI-Augmented Story Development Framework

## Creative Seed
"A librarian discovers a book that appears to predict future events."

## Collaborative Development Process

### Phase 1: Conceptual Expansion
[YOUR TURN]
Start by sharing your initial vision for:
- The librarian character (personality, background, motivations)
- The nature of the book (appearance, how it works, limitations)
- The setting (time period, type of library, community)

[MY TURN]
I'll then offer 3-5 unexpected elements that could enhance the concept:
- Potential magical realism elements
- Thematic dimensions to explore
- Unusual narrative structures that might fit

### Phase 2: Character & Conflict Development
[ALTERNATING]
- You: Select character elements that resonate with your vision
- Me: Suggest internal and external conflicts that create tension
- You: Choose or modify conflicts that feel authentic
- Me: Propose how these conflicts might intersect with the predictive book

### Phase 3: Narrative Structure Exploration
[MY TURN]
I'll provide 3 possible narrative structures specifically suited for magical realism short stories involving prediction/fate:
- Structure 1: [Structure description]
- Structure 2: [Structure description]
- Structure 3: [Structure description]

[YOUR TURN]
Select or modify a structure that appeals to you.

### Phase 4: Scene Generation & Refinement
[ALTERNATING]
For each key scene in our structure:
- I'll suggest a scene framework with magical realism elements
- You'll expand with specific details and character reactions
- I'll offer unexpected directions or subtle elements
- You'll integrate what resonates and redirect what doesn't

### Phase 5: Thematic Enrichment
[MY TURN]
Based on our development so far, I'll identify potential thematic layers:
- Primary theme possibilities
- Secondary theme possibilities
- Symbolic patterns that could be woven throughout

[YOUR TURN]
Select themes that align with your creative vision.

### Phase 6: Synthesis & Refinement
[SHARED]
We'll iteratively develop the complete narrative, with:
- You guiding the overall direction and making final creative decisions
- Me offering suggestions to enhance magical realism elements, maintain coherence, and resolve narrative challenges

## Creative Reminders:
• Magical realism thrives on treating the extraordinary as ordinary
• Short stories benefit from focused conflict and limited character arcs
• The predictive element can function as metaphor as well as plot device

Shall we begin with your initial thoughts on the librarian, book, and setting?
```

## 4. Cross-Domain Applications

### Example 4.1: Clinical Cognitive Support

```python
from prompt_theory.applications import ClinicalCognitiveSupport
from prompt_theory.models import WorkingMemoryModel, AttentionModel

    working_memory_model=wm_model,
    attention_model=attention_model,
    clinical_population="elderly_mild_cognitive_impairment"
)

# Complex medication instructions to optimize
medication_instructions = """
Take Lisinopril 10mg once daily in the morning with or without food. Take Metformin 500mg twice daily with meals, once in the morning and once in the evening. Take Atorvastatin 20mg once daily in the evening. If you experience muscle pain, call your doctor immediately. Take Aspirin 81mg once daily with food. Remember to check your blood pressure daily and record the values.
"""

    instructions=medication_instructions,
    optimization_level="high",
    include_visual_aids=True,
    include_memory_supports=True
)

# Your Daily Medication Schedule

## MORNING
[ ] WITH BREAKFAST:
    • Lisinopril (10mg) - blood pressure pill
    • Metformin (500mg) - diabetes pill
    • Aspirin (81mg) - small pink pill

## EVENING
[ ] WITH DINNER:
    • Metformin (500mg) - diabetes pill
    • Atorvastatin (20mg) - cholesterol pill

## Daily Health Check
[ ] Check blood pressure once each morning
[ ] Write down the numbers in your health notebook

## Important Reminder
If you notice MUSCLE PAIN, call Dr. Johnson right away at (555) 123-4567

----------------------------

* Place this schedule on your refrigerator
* Use a pill organizer box to set up each week's medications
* Check off each medication after you take it
* Ask for help from a family member if needed

Would you like me to also create a simplified visual chart of this schedule with pictures of the pills?

### Example 4.2: Interface Design Optimization

```python
from prompt_theory.applications import InterfaceDesignOptimizer
from prompt_theory.models import AttentionModel, CognitiveLoadModel

# Initialize cognitive models
attention_model = AttentionModel(
    capacity=5,  # Conservative estimate for diverse users
    recency_bias=0.4,
    salience_weight=0.6
)

cognitive_load_model = CognitiveLoadModel(
    working_memory_capacity=5,
    processing_efficiency_factor=0.7,
    distraction_sensitivity=0.4
)

# Initialize interface design optimizer
interface_optimizer = InterfaceDesignOptimizer(
    attention_model=attention_model,
    cognitive_load_model=cognitive_load_model,
    user_expertise="novice"
)

# Interface elements to optimize
interface_elements = {
    "primary_actions": ["Save", "Edit", "Delete", "Share", "Export", "Print"],
    "secondary_actions": ["Rename", "Move", "Copy", "Add Tag", "Permissions", "Version History", "Comments"],
    "navigation": ["Home", "Recent", "Shared", "Favorites", "Trash"],
    "user_status": ["Storage Usage", "Notifications", "Account Settings"]
}

# Generate optimized interface recommendations

    interface_elements=interface_elements,
    screen_size="mobile",
    primary_task="document_management",
    optimization_targets=["reduced_cognitive_load", "intuitive_hierarchy"]
)

print(interface_recommendations)
```

**Output:**
```
# Interface Optimization Recommendations
## For Mobile Document Management App (Novice Users)

### 1. Primary Actions Optimization
Current cognitive load: HIGH (6 equally-weighted actions)
Recommendation: Reduce visible primary actions to 3-4 most frequent

#### Optimized Primary Actions Bar:
1. Edit (most fundamental action)
2. Save (critical data preservation)
3. Share (high social value)
4. More... (dropdown for remaining actions)

Place these in a persistent bottom action bar with distinct icons + text labels.

### 2. Information Hierarchy
Current state: Flat hierarchy with 19 total elements
Recommendation: Create 3-tier information architecture

#### Tier 1 (Always Visible):
- Primary document view
- Bottom action bar (Edit, Save, Share, More...)
- Simplified header with document title and back button

#### Tier 2 (One Action Away):
- "More..." menu containing: Delete, Export, Print
- Navigation drawer (swipe or hamburger menu)
- Quick status indicator (storage only, expandable)

#### Tier 3 (Two Actions Away):
- Secondary actions grouped by function:
  * Document Properties (Rename, Move, Copy)
  * Collaboration (Add Tag, Permissions, Comments)
  * System (Version History)

### 3. Attention Management
Current issues: Competing attention demands, no clear visual hierarchy
Recommendations:

1. Use color saturation to create hierarchy:
   - 100% saturation: Primary actions
   - 70% saturation: Secondary elements
   - 40% saturation: Tertiary elements

2. Implement progressive disclosure:
   - Start with minimal interface
   - Reveal options contextually based on user actions
   - Use animation to guide attention to newly revealed elements

3. Reduce cognitive load during navigation:
   - Maintain persistent document title
   - Provide clear "back" mechanism with destination preview
   - Use breadcrumbs for complex navigation paths

### 4. Implementation Priority
1. Restructure action hierarchy (highest impact)
2. Implement progressive disclosure patterns
3. Apply consistent visual hierarchy
4. Add attention-guiding micro-interactions

Would you like wireframes illustrating these recommendations?
```

# Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

I'll explain how CNNs work for image classification using a combination of text explanations, visual diagrams, and simple code examples.

## 1. The Big Picture

[IMAGE: Overview diagram showing an input image passing through convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to produce a classification output]

CNNs are specialized neural networks designed to process grid-like data (such as images) by applying filters that detect features like edges, textures, and patterns.

## 2. Key Components

### Convolutional Layers
These layers apply filters (kernels) to detect features:

[IMAGE: Animation showing a 3x3 filter sliding across an image, highlighting feature detection]

```python
# Simple example of a convolutional operation
import numpy as np
from scipy import signal

# A simple 3x3 image (for illustration)
image = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0]
])

# An edge detection filter
edge_filter = np.array([
    [-1, -1, -1],
    [-1,  8, -1],
    [-1, -1, -1]
])

# Applying the filter
filtered_image = signal.convolve2d(image, edge_filter, mode='same')
