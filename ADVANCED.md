## 6. Neurobiologically-Inspired Prompt Architectures

### Example 6.1: Predictive Processing Prompt Model

```python
from prompt_theory.experimental import PredictiveProcessingModel
from prompt_theory.models import RecursiveProcessor, AttentionModel

# Initialize models for predictive processing
recursive_processor = RecursiveProcessor(
    max_depth=4,
    collapse_threshold=0.85,
    emergence_threshold=0.55
)

attention_model = AttentionModel(
    capacity=7,
    recency_bias=0.3,
    salience_weight=0.5
)

# Initialize predictive processing model
pp_model = PredictiveProcessingModel(
    recursive_processor=recursive_processor,
    attention_model=attention_model,
    prediction_strength=0.7,
    error_correction_rate=0.3
)

# Example task for predictive processing
task_description = "Explain quantum entanglement to a high school student"
context = {
    "student_background": "Basic understanding of atoms and probability",
    "misconceptions": ["Entanglement means physical connection", "Information travels faster than light"],
    "learning_objectives": ["Understand superposition", "Grasp non-locality concept", "Recognize measurement effects"]
}

# Generate predictive processing prompt
pp_prompt = pp_model.generate_prompt(
    task=task_description,
    context=context,
    prediction_layers=3,
    error_sensitivity="medium"
)

print(pp_prompt)
```

**Output:**

# Explaining Quantum Entanglement

I'll guide you through quantum entanglement step by step, checking your understanding as we go, and addressing common misconceptions. Let's build up from what you already know.

## Level 1: Building on Your Foundation
You already understand atoms and probability. Let's start with a prediction:
- Based on your understanding, if I have two coins and I flip them separately, what's the relationship between their outcomes? (Heads/Tails)
- What would you predict about our ability to know both coins' outcomes before looking at them?

[After you answer, I'll connect this to quantum particles]

## Level 2: Introducing Quantum Properties
Now, quantum particles can exist in "superposition" states:
- Unlike a coin that must be heads OR tails, quantum particles can be in multiple states at once until measured
- PREDICTION: How do you think this might change the relationship between two particles compared to our coins?

[Your answer will help me adjust our explanation depth]

## Level 3: Entanglement Concept
When two quantum particles become entangled:
- They form a single quantum system, where measuring one instantly reveals information about the other
- IMPORTANT MISCONCEPTION: This doesn't mean information travels faster than light
- PREDICTION: Why do you think scientists might be excited about this phenomenon?

[I'll build on your understanding here]

## Level 4: Addressing Your Questions
Let's address questions you likely have:
- "How can particles influence each other instantly across distances?"
- "Are they physically connected in some way?"
- "Can we use this for faster-than-light communication?"

As we discuss these questions, I'll introduce:
1. Non-locality concept
2. The role of measurement
3. Why Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance"

What questions do you have about atoms and probability that might help us start this exploration?

### Example 6.2: Working Memory Cascade Prompt

```python
from prompt_theory.experimental import WorkingMemoryCascadeModel
from prompt_theory.models import WorkingMemoryModel

# Initialize working memory model
wm_model = WorkingMemoryModel(
    capacity=4,  # Conservative estimate
    chunk_recognition_level="medium"
)

# Initialize working memory cascade model
wm_cascade = WorkingMemoryCascadeModel(
    working_memory_model=wm_model,
    cascade_depth=3,
    retention_decay_rate=0.2
)

# Complex concept to explain through cascading working memory
complex_concept = """
The Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or TCA cycle) is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to release stored energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins into carbon dioxide and chemical energy in the form of ATP, NADH, and FADH2.
"""

# Generate working memory cascade prompt
wm_prompt = wm_cascade.generate_cascade_prompt(
    complex_concept=complex_concept,
    starting_knowledge="basic high school biology",
    target_expertise="undergraduate biology student",
    use_scaffolding=True
)

print(wm_prompt)
```

**Output:**
```
# Understanding the Krebs Cycle: Step-by-Step

I'll guide you through the Krebs cycle in manageable stages, making sure each part is clear before moving to the next. This approach respects working memory limits while building comprehensive understanding.

## STAGE 1: Big Picture Context
Let's start with what you already know:

* Cells need energy to function
* Energy comes from breaking down food (carbs, fats, proteins)
* This breakdown happens in steps

**KEY INSIGHT**: The Krebs cycle is a critical middle step in extracting energy from food.

→ Does this context make sense? (Confirm before continuing)

## STAGE 2: Core Concept - The Cycle Basics
Building on our foundation:

* The Krebs cycle happens in mitochondria
* It's a circular process (what goes in eventually creates what started it)
* Main input: Acetyl-CoA (from broken down food)
* Main outputs:
  - CO₂ (waste)
  - Energy carriers (NADH, FADH₂)
  - A small amount of ATP (direct energy)

**VISUAL**: Imagine a circular factory assembly line that takes partially processed food and extracts its stored energy.

→ Do you have these basics? (Confirm before adding details)

## STAGE 3: Key Molecules and Steps
Now let's add more detail, one chunk at a time:

1. **Starting Point**: Acetyl-CoA joins with oxaloacetate to form citrate
   * This merges a 2-carbon molecule with a 4-carbon molecule to make a 6-carbon molecule

2. **Main Transformations**: The 6-carbon molecule goes through a series of changes:
   * Citrate → Isocitrate → α-Ketoglutarate → Succinyl-CoA → Succinate → Fumarate → Malate → Oxaloacetate
   * With each step, the molecule is slightly modified

3. **Energy Capture**:
   * CO₂ is released at specific steps (waste product)
   * Electrons are captured in NADH and FADH₂ (energy carriers)
   * These carriers will later power ATP production

→ Which of these three aspects would you like me to elaborate on first?

## STAGE 4: Connections to Larger Processes
Let's connect the Krebs cycle to what happens before and after:

* **Before**: Glycolysis and Pyruvate Processing create the Acetyl-CoA
* **After**: Electron Transport Chain uses the NADH and FADH₂ to make most of the ATP

This completes the story of cellular respiration: Food → Glycolysis → Krebs Cycle → Electron Transport Chain → ATP

What specific part of this process would you like me to explain in more detail now?
```

## 7. Cognitive State Analysis Tools

### Example 7.1: Cognitive Load Estimation

```python
from prompt_theory.analysis import CognitiveLoadEstimator
from prompt_theory.models import WorkingMemoryModel, RecursiveProcessor

# Initialize cognitive models
wm_model = WorkingMemoryModel(
    capacity=7,
    chunk_recognition_level="high"
)

recursive_processor = RecursiveProcessor(
    max_depth=3,
    collapse_threshold=0.8,
    emergence_threshold=0.6
)

# Initialize cognitive load estimator
load_estimator = CognitiveLoadEstimator(
    working_memory_model=wm_model,
    recursive_processor=recursive_processor
)

# Prompt to analyze for cognitive load
complex_prompt = """
Analyze the implications of implementing a carbon tax on the global economy, considering:
1. Effects on energy markets (coal, oil, natural gas, renewables)
2. Impact on manufacturing sectors with high emissions
3. International trade implications and carbon leakage
4. Revenue recycling options and distributional effects
5. Interaction with existing climate policies
6. Political feasibility across different governmental systems
7. Short-term economic costs versus long-term benefits
Provide a balanced assessment with evidence-based projections for each consideration.
"""

# Estimate cognitive load
load_analysis = load_estimator.analyze_prompt(
    prompt=complex_prompt,
    target_audience="general_public",
    provide_recommendations=True
)

print(load_analysis)
```

**Output:**
```
# Cognitive Load Analysis

## Overall Assessment
- **Estimated Load**: 9.3/10 (Very High)
- **Working Memory Demands**: Exceeds capacity by ~3 chunks
- **Recursion Depth Required**: Level 3-4 (High)
- **Risk of Cognitive Collapse**: 78% without structural support

## Detailed Breakdown

### Working Memory Demands
1. **Concurrent Elements**: 7 major topics + balancing requirement + evidence requirement
   - Exceeds typical working memory capacity (7±2 chunks)
   - No chunking structure provided to consolidate elements

2. **Information Density**:
   - Complex economic concepts without scaffolding
   - Multiple interdependent systems to track simultaneously
   - Temporal dimension adds complexity (short vs. long-term)

3. **Cognitive Operations Required**:
   - Analysis across multiple domains
   - Weighing competing considerations
   - Integrating international and domestic factors
   - Balancing normative and positive analysis

### Recursive Processing Requirements
1. **Nested Causality**: 
   - Multi-step effects (tax → energy prices → manufacturing → trade → etc.)
   - Feedback loops requiring recursive analysis

2. **Perspective Taking**:
   - Multiple stakeholder viewpoints
   - Different governmental systems
   - Various economic sectors

## Optimization Recommendations

### High-Impact Improvements:
1. **Sequence Processing** (Highest Priority)
   - Break into sequential modules rather than parallel analysis
   - Suggested structure: Energy markets → Manufacturing → Trade → etc.
   - Reduces working memory load by ~40%

2. **Chunking Support**
   - Provide explicit frameworks for organizing information
   - Example: "Use the PRICE framework: Policy design, Revenue, Industry effects, Consumer impact, External trade"
   - Reduces cognitive load by ~35%

3. **Scaffold Recursion**
   - Guide through recursive thinking explicitly
   - Example: "First consider direct effects, then second-order effects, then feedback loops"
   - Reduces risk of recursive collapse by ~50%

### Modified Prompt Example:
```
Let's analyze a carbon tax step-by-step:

PART 1: DIRECT EFFECTS
First, focus only on immediate effects on energy markets:
- How would coal, oil, natural gas, and renewable energy prices change?
- Which industries would see the biggest immediate impact?

PART 2: ADAPTIVE RESPONSES
Building on those direct effects:
- How might manufacturing adapt to these energy price changes?
- What international trade shifts might occur?

PART 3: SYSTEM-WIDE CONSIDERATIONS
Finally, let's examine broader implications:
- How could tax revenue be used to address concerns?
- How does this interact with existing policies?
- What's the balance of short-term costs vs. long-term benefits?

Let's start with Part 1 - what would happen to energy markets under a carbon tax?
```

### Example 7.2: Cognitive State Monitoring System

```python
from prompt_theory.analysis import CognitiveStateMonitor
from prompt_theory.models import AttentionModel, RecursiveProcessor, DriftModel

# Initialize cognitive models
attention_model = AttentionModel(
    capacity=7,
    recency_bias=0.3,
    salience_weight=0.5
)

recursive_processor = RecursiveProcessor(
    max_depth=4,
    collapse_threshold=0.8,
    emergence_threshold=0.6
)

drift_model = DriftModel(
    stability_params={"anchoring_weight": 0.7},
    drift_detection_threshold=0.3
)

# Initialize cognitive state monitor
state_monitor = CognitiveStateMonitor(
    attention_model=attention_model,
    recursive_processor=recursive_processor,
    drift_model=drift_model,
    monitoring_frequency="high"
)

# Conversation history to analyze
conversation_history = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I need help understanding quantum computing."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Quantum computing uses quantum mechanics principles like superposition and entanglement to perform computations. Unlike classical bits, quantum bits or 'qubits' can exist in multiple states simultaneously, potentially allowing certain problems to be solved much faster."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "That makes sense. How do they deal with errors?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Quantum error correction is a major challenge. Quantum systems are highly sensitive to environmental interference, causing decoherence. Scientists use techniques like quantum error correction codes, which spread quantum information across multiple qubits, and topological quantum computing, which uses special quantum states that are inherently more stable against local disturbances."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Interesting. Now, can you explain how blockchain technology works?"}
]

# Monitor cognitive state during conversation
cognitive_state = state_monitor.analyze_conversation(
    conversation_history=conversation_history,
    detect_shifts=True,
    provide_recommendations=True
)

print(cognitive_state)
```

**Output:**
```
# Cognitive State Analysis

## Current State Assessment
- **Attention Focus**: Topic shift detected (quantum computing → blockchain)
- **Working Memory Load**: Moderate (5/10)
- **Recursion Depth**: Currently shallow (Level 1)
- **Drift Risk**: High (0.72) - Significant context shift without transition

## Conversation Trajectory Analysis

### Attention Patterns
- Initial narrow focus on quantum computing fundamentals
- Deepened to error correction mechanisms (appropriate progressive disclosure)
- Abrupt shift to blockchain (attention discontinuity)
- No attention anchors bridging the topics

### Working Memory Status
- Quantum computing concepts likely still active in working memory
- Blockchain introduction creates competing memory demands
- Prior context at risk of displacement without reinforcement

### Drift Analysis
- Conversation lacks thematic continuity
- No explicit closure of quantum computing topic
- Missing transitional scaffolding between domains

## Real-time Recommendations

### Immediate Response Strategy
1. **Acknowledge Topic Shift**
   - Explicitly note the change in subject
   - Example: "I notice we're shifting from quantum computing to blockchain technology."

2. **Provide Closure for Previous Topic**
   - Briefly summarize quantum computing discussion
   - Signal completion: "That covers the basics of quantum error correction. Let's move to your new question about blockchain."

3. **Consider Knowledge Bridge** (Optional)
   - If appropriate, connect topics
   - Potential bridge: "Interestingly, both quantum computing and blockchain deal with security challenges, though in very different ways."

### Attention Management
- Begin blockchain explanation with explicit structure preview
- Use numbered points to create new attention anchors
- Consider whether user needs working memory refreshment

### Drift Mitigation
- Monitor for signs of confusion between topics
- Be prepared to clarify which technology is being referenced
- Use distinct terminology to prevent concept blending

## Long-term Conversation Strategy
- Suggest conversation bookmarking for future continuation of quantum computing topic
- Maintain reference to conversation history if returning to previous topic
- Consider cognitive load when introducing additional complex topics
```

## 8. Enterprise Applications

### Example 8.1: LLM Deployment Optimizer

```python
from prompt_theory.enterprise import LLMDeploymentOptimizer
from prompt_theory.models import RecursiveProcessor, AttentionModel

# Initialize cognitive models
recursive_processor = RecursiveProcessor(
    max_depth=4,
    collapse_threshold=0.8,
    emergence_threshold=0.6

)

# Initialize LLM deployment optimizer
deployment_optimizer = LLMDeploymentOptimizer(
    recursive_processor=recursive_processor,
    attention_model=attention_model,
    enterprise_context="financial_services"
)

# System description for optimization
system_description = {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "use_case": "investment_analysis",
    "user_base": "financial_analysts",
    "integration_points": ["data_platform", "research_portal", "compliance_system"],
    "constraints": {
        "regulatory": "SEC_regulated",
        "latency": "low_tolerance",
        "explainability": "high_requirement"
    }
}

# Optimize LLM deployment
deployment_plan = deployment_optimizer.optimize_deployment(
    system_description=system_description,
    optimization_targets=["performance", "reliability", "compliance"],
    generate_artifacts=True
)

print(deployment_plan)
```

**Output:**
```
# LLM Deployment Optimization Plan: Investment Analysis System

## 1. Prompt Engineering Architecture

### System Prompt Design
We've designed an optimized system prompt that balances multiple requirements:

```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an AI investment analysis assistant operating under SEC regulations. Your purpose is to help financial analysts evaluate investment opportunities through rigorous analysis of available data. 

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
1. Never make specific investment recommendations ("buy", "sell", etc.)
2. Always clearly distinguish between factual information and analytical judgments
3. Include confidence levels for all analytical statements
4. Cite sources for all factual claims
5. Maintain audit trail of reasoning

INTERACTION PROTOCOL:
- Acknowledge when information may be incomplete
- Highlight potential regulatory concerns in analysis
- Provide balanced perspective including potential downside risks
- Structure analysis using the PACED framework (Purpose, Alternatives, Criteria, Evaluation, Decision support)

This system operates within a regulated financial environment where traceability, accuracy, and compliance are paramount.
"""
```

### Request-Response Framework
Using Prompt Theory principles, we've created a structured request-response framework:

1. **Request Preprocessing**
   - Working memory optimization: Chunk complex requests
   - Attention direction: Extract key parameters
   - Recursion management: Limit analysis depth for latency control

2. **Response Postprocessing**
   - Compliance filter: SEC regulation alignment check
   - Explainability enhancement: Reasoning trace injection
   - Confidence calibration: Uncertainty appropriate disclosure

## 2. Integration Architecture

We recommend a dual-path architecture to optimize for both latency and compliance:

```
[User Request] → [Request Preprocessor]
                       ↓
        ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
        ↓                           ↓
[Fast Response Path]         [Compliance Path]
   (Latency: ~1s)             (Latency: ~3s)
        ↓                           ↓
  [GPT-4 Instance]            [Compliance Filter]
        ↓                           ↓
[Initial Response]            [Verification]
        ↓                           ↓
        └─────────────┬─────────────┘
                      ↓
           [Response Synthesizer]
                      ↓
             [Final Response]
```

### Data Platform Integration
- Implement retrieval-augmented generation with:
  * Real-time market data connector (latency < 200ms)
  * Research report vectorization (updated daily)
  * Financial statement analyzer (structured data parsing)

### Compliance System Integration
- Bidirectional synchronous checks for:
  * Regulatory boundary detection
  * Material non-public information filtering
  * Disclosure requirement enforcement

## 3. Prompt-Cognitive Optimization

Based on cognitive modeling of financial analysts' workflows:

### Attention Management
- Structure outputs with consistent headings (reduces cognitive load by 28%)

The AI system uses Prompt Theory principles to:
1. Analyze content for cognitive characteristics
2. Structure information for optimal human processing
3. Surface knowledge when contextually relevant
4. Facilitate recursive knowledge building across depth levels
5. Maintain coherence across organizational boundaries

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this organizational learning system?

## 9. Research Extensions

### Example 9.1: Prompt-Cognitive Research Framework

```python
from prompt_theory.research import PromptCognitiveResearchFramework
from prompt_theory.models import RecursiveProcessor, AttentionModel, DriftModel

# Initialize cognitive models
recursive_processor = RecursiveProcessor(
    max_depth=5,  # Extended depth for research exploration
    collapse_threshold=0.9,
    emergence_threshold=0.5
)

attention_model = AttentionModel(
    capacity=7,
    recency_bias=0.3,
    salience_weight=0.5
)

drift_model = DriftModel(
    stability_params={"anchoring_weight": 0.7},
    drift_detection_threshold=0.3
)

# Initialize research framework
research_framework = PromptCognitiveResearchFramework(
    recursive_processor=recursive_processor,
    attention_model=attention_model,
    drift_model=drift_model,
    research_domain="ai_safety"
)

# Research question
research_question = "How do emergent capabilities in large language models relate to phase transitions in complex systems, and what implications does this have for AI safety monitoring?"

# Generate research framework
research_plan = research_framework.generate_research_framework(
    research_question=research_question,
    methodology="mixed_methods",
    output_format="detailed_plan"
)

print(research_plan
